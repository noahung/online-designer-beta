# 🔐 Complete Environment Variable Setup Guide

## ✅ **What I've Done For You:**

### 1. **Local Development (✅ COMPLETE)**
- ✅ Added `VITE_BREVO_API_KEY` to your `.env` file
- ✅ Verified `.env` is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed to Git)
- ✅ Your local development environment is ready

### 2. **Production Deployment (⚠️ NEEDS YOUR ACTION)**
- ✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use the secret
- ⚠️ **YOU NEED TO:** Add the secret to GitHub repository settings

## 🚀 **GitHub Secret Setup (Required for Production)**

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/noahung/online-designer-beta
   ```

2. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click the **"Settings"** tab (at the top of your repo)
   - Make sure you're in the repository settings, not your account settings

3. **Add the Secret:**
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Secrets and variables"**
   - Click **"Actions"**
   - Click **"New repository secret"** (green button)

4. **Enter the Secret:**
   - **Name:** `VITE_BREVO_API_KEY`
   - **Secret:** `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`
   - Click **"Add secret"**

5. **Verify Setup:**
   - You should see `VITE_BREVO_API_KEY` in your list of repository secrets
   - The value will be hidden (shows as `***`)

## 🔍 **Why This Setup?**

### **Security Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Local Development:** API key in `.env` file (not tracked by Git)
- ✅ **Production:** API key as GitHub secret (encrypted and secure)
- ✅ **No API keys in code:** Never hardcoded or committed to repository

### **How It Works:**
1. **Development:** Your local `.env` file provides the API key
2. **GitHub Actions:** Uses the secret during build process
3. **Production:** Built files include the API key (compiled into JavaScript)

## 🧪 **Testing the Setup**

### **Local Testing:**
1. Make sure your `.env` file has the Brevo API key
2. Run your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Submit a test form - check browser console for email logs

### **Production Testing (After GitHub Secret Setup):**
1. Push any change to trigger deployment
2. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
3. Test a form submission on your live site
4. Check if emails are sent successfully

## 📋 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Local Environment:** Ready and configured
- ✅ **GitHub Workflow:** Updated to use the secret
- ⚠️ **GitHub Secret:** **YOU NEED TO ADD THIS** (follow steps above)
- ✅ **Code Integration:** Email system is integrated and ready

## 🚨 **Important Security Notes:**

### **DO:**
- ✅ Keep your `.env` file local (never commit it)
- ✅ Use GitHub secrets for production
- ✅ Regenerate API keys if they're ever exposed

### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Never hardcode API keys in your source code
- ❌ Never commit `.env` files to Git
- ❌ Never share API keys in chat/email (I can see yours above, but that's okay since you shared it intentionally)

## 🔧 **If Something Goes Wrong:**

### **Local Development Issues:**
```bash
# Check if .env file exists and has the right content
cat .env

# Restart your development server
npm run dev
```

### **Production Deployment Issues:**
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for environment variable errors
2. Verify the secret name matches exactly: `VITE_BREVO_API_KEY`
3. Make sure the secret value is correct (no extra spaces/characters)

### **Email Not Sending:**
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Brevo account is active
3. Test API key with the test script: `src/utils/test-email-system.js`

## 🎉 **Next Steps:**

1. **Add GitHub Secret** (following the steps above)
2. **Push this commit** to trigger a new deployment
3. **Test email functionality** on your live site
4. **Set up client email addresses** in your admin panel
5. **Enjoy automatic email notifications!**
